# Clustering
This project involves customer segmentation for a supermarket mall using K-means, hierarchical, and density-based clustering. By analyzing customer data (age, income, spending score), we aim to divide customers into distinct groups to inform targeted marketing strategies for improved customer satisfaction and sales.
